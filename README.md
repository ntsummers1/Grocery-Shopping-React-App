I took inspiration in the design from [this grocery shopping app.](https://www.behance.net/gallery/98460197/Grocery-Shopping-App?tracking_source=search_projects%7Cshopping%20cart%20website%20design) I thought this was so cool I wanted to see it live and try making it myself, so here it is!

## Project Information

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

It also takes advantage of the Restful CRUD API that I built using Express, NodeJS, and MongoDB. You can find that project [here](https://github.com/ntsummers1/Grocery-Shopping-Express-API). You'll want to run that project before you run this one.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn lint`

ESlint this bad boy.

### `yarn format`

And then make it extra pretty.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
